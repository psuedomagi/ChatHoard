# ChatHoard Contributor Code of Conduct

## Contributions welcome!

As I write this, I'm the only contributor. I would *love* additional contributors to join this project and move it forward. I do have some ground rules, though. I want this to be a welcoming and inclusive project. I want to foster a positive environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. If you are not okay with any of that, then you are not welcome to contribute to this project.

## Standards

When this project becomes a community project, I will hold myself and all contributors to the following standards:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accept constructive criticism with grace
* Focus on what is best for the project
* Show empathy towards other community members and seek to understand their perspective

I will not tolerate:

* Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (doxing)
* Anything that wouldn't be acceptable in a professional setting

## Your Responsibilities as a Maintainer

If you become a maintainer of this project, you are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

You have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that you deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Any clear violaters should be permanently banned.

## Scope

Always applies. I will not tolerate any behavior that doesn't align with these standards in *any* setting. If you can't be accepting, civil, and respectful, then you aren't welcome here.

## Enforcement

Please report any unacceptable behavior to me at mule_menthol0t at icloud.com. I will review and investigate all complaints and respond seriously and appropriately while maintaining confidentiality.
