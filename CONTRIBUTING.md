# Anyone Can Contribute

Thank you for considering contributing to this repo!

**I welcome any contribution. You can improve documentation, triage bugs, write tutorials, fix small and large mistakes, add features, or refactor the whole shebang (let's discuss that last one first though).**

**When you submit a contribution, you agree to license your work under the same license as this project.**

## Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
>
> * No code snobbery allowed. Everyone starts somewhere; help, guide, mentor if you know a better, cleaner, way.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Your First Contribution

If you've never contributed to a project before, this guide should help you get started: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## The short version of how to contribute:

* **Code changes**: Open an issue for the problem or feature you want to address using the provided templates in [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/). For small changes, you can go ahead and make your changes in a branch and submit a pull request referencing the issue number. For big changes, let's discuss it first.
* **Other changes**: Just follow the steps below. You don't need to start with an issue unless it's a major change. You can explain your motivation in the Pull Request.

**Process**:

* Fork the repo and clone it to your machine. Use the `dev` branch as your base.
* Create a branch for your changes.
* Make your changes.
* Test your changes.
* Push your changes to your fork.
* Open a pull request in the `dev` branch.

**Please use the provided [pull request template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) in the .github folder for all PRs.**

I (and other maintainers when we have some...) will regularly review pull requests and approve them after review. If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
