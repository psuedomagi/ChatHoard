# Security Policy

Security is very important for this project and its community. ðŸ”’

Learn more about it below. ðŸ‘‡

## Versions

The latest version or release is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: mule_menthol0t at icloud.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please don't discuss potential security vulnerabilities in public. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
