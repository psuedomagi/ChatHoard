This project is built on the backs of titans:

- It makes heavy use of Sebastián Ramírez's Full-StackFastAPI-Template, which is a great starting point for any FastAPI project and includes FastAPI, SQLModel, and much more. You can find it [here](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template). That content is also licensed under the MIT License, Copyright 2019 Sebastián Ramírez.
